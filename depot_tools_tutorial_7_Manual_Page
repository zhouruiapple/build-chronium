NAME

depot_tools_tutorial - A tutorial introduction to the Chromium depot_tools git extensions.

DESCRIPTION

The Chromium depot_tools(7) suite contains many git workflow-enhancing tools which are designed to work together to enable anyone to wrangle the Chromium codebase expertly. This tutorial explains how to do development on Chromium using these tools. This will cover:

Setting up

Getting the code

TL;DR

Creating / Uploading a CL

Updating the code

Managing multiple CLs

Managing dependent CLs

Example Walkthrough

Please refer to the manpages (or --help output) for details about any of the commands mentioned in this tutorial.

Note
If your platform does not support manpages (or you prefer something a bit more expressive than plain text) you can find all documentation in html form in the [DEPOT_TOOLS]/man/html folder.
PREREQUISITES
This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with git terminology and concepts. If you need to brush up on these, the following are very good resources:

Think like (a) Git - A lighthearted overview of git. If you’re sorta-familiar with git, but not comfortable with it, then give this a look.

Git Immersion Tutorial - An in-depth git tutorial.

pcottle’s Visual Git Branching - An excellent interactive/graphical demo on how git handles commits, branches, and shows the operations git performs on them.

Pro Git book - “The” book for learning git from basics to advanced concepts. A bit dry, but very through.

If you’ve tried these out and are still having some trouble getting started, there are many other resources online which should help. If you’re really really stuck, then chat up one of the Chromium infrastructure team members for some pointers.

Litmus Test
If you know what git add, git status, git commit do and you know essentially what git rebase does, then you should know enough to follow along.

SETTING UP

GET DEPOT TOOLS
LINUX / MAC

Clone the depot_tools repository:

$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
Add depot_tools to the end of your PATH (you will probably want to put this in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc). Assuming you cloned depot_tools to /path/to/depot_tools:

$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools
WINDOWS

Download the depot_tools bundle and extract it somewhere.

Warning
DO NOT use drag-n-drop or copy-n-paste extract from Explorer, this will not extract the hidden “.git” folder which is necessary for depot_tools to autoupdate itself. You can use “Extract all…” from the context menu though.
Add depot_tools to the end of your PATH. Assuming you unzipped the bundle to C:\workspace\depot_tools:

With Administrator access:
Control Panel → System and Security → System → Advanced system settings

Modify the PATH system variable to include C:\workspace\depot_tools.

Without Administrator access:
Control Panel → User Accounts → User Accounts → Change my environment variables

Add a PATH user variable: %PATH%;C:\workspace\depot_tools.

From a cmd.exe shell, run the command gclient (without arguments). On first run, gclient will install all the Windows-specific bits needed to work with the code, including msysgit and python.

Note
If you run gclient from a non-cmd shell (e.g., cygwin, PowerShell), it may appear to run properly, but msysgit, python, and other tools may not get installed correctly.

If you see strange errors with the file system on the first run of gclient, you may want to disable Windows Indexing.

If you are running Windows XP and see errors like “The system cannot execute the specified program”, try installing the “Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package”.

BOOTSTRAPPING CONFIGURATION
If you have never used git before, you’ll need to set some global git configurations; substitute your name and email address in the following commands:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email "jdoe@email.com"
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
$ git config --global core.filemode false
$ # and for fun!
$ git config --global color.ui true
TL;DR

$ # get the code
$ # In an empty directory:
$ fetch {chromium,blink,...}

$ # Update third_party repos and run pre-compile hooks
$ gclient sync

$ # Make a new change and upload it for review
$ git new-branch <branch_name>
$ # repeat: [edit, git add, git commit]
$ git cl upload

$ # After change is reviewed, commit with the CQ
$ git cl set_commit
$ # Note that the committed hash which lands will /not/ match the
$ # commit hashes of your local branch.
GETTING THE CODE

Pick an empty directory and run one of the following:

$ fetch chromium  # Basic checkout for desktop Chromium
$ fetch blink     # Chromium code with Blink checked out to tip-of-tree
$ fetch android   # Chromium checkout for Android platform
$ fetch ios       # Chromium checkout for iOS platform
When the fetch tool completes you should have the following in your working directory:

.gclient   # A configuration file for you source checkout
src/       # Top-level Chromium source checkout.
If you are on linux and fetching the code for the first time, then you’ll need to run:

$ cd src && ./build/install-build-deps.sh
And finally:

$ gclient sync
This will pull all dependencies of the Chromium src checkout. You will need to run this any time you update the main src checkout, including when you switch branches.

CREATING / UPLOADING A CL

Note
The remainder of the tutorial assumes that your current working directory is the src/ folder mentioned in Getting the code.
Each CL corresponds exactly with a single branch in git. Any time you want to begin a new CL:

$ git new-branch <branch_name>
This will create and checkout a new branch named branch_name which will track the default upstream branch (origin/master). See git-new-branch(1) for more features.

Commit as many changes as you like to this branch. When you want to upload it for review, run:

$ git cl upload
This will take the diff of your branch against its upstream branch (in that case origin/master), and will post it to the Chromium code review site.

UPDATING THE CODE

Inevitably, you’ll want to pull in changes from the main Chromium repo. This is pretty easy with depot_tools:

$ git rebase-update
This command will update all of your CLs to contain the latest code from their upstreams. It will also automatically clean up CLs which have been committed and a couple other nice things. See git-rebase-update(1) for the full scoop.

One thing to look out for are merge conflicts. These happen for exactly the same as they do with SVN, but the experience is a little more controllable with git. git rebase-update will try to rebase all your branches for you, but if it encounters a merge conflict in one, it will halt and leave you in a rebase conflict state (see git-rebase(1)). Resolving git rebase merge conflicts is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but there are many good sources online (see the Prerequisites for some).

Sometimes you’re pretty certain that you’ve committed a certain branch, but git rebase-update isn’t able to tell that for sure. This is usually because your branch doesn’t rebase cleanly. You could just delete the branch with git branch -D <branch>, but you’d like to double check the diff of your branch against its upstream before deleting it. If this is the case you can abort the rebase started by git rebase-update, and then run git-squash-branch(1) to flatten your branch into a single commit. When you run git rebase-update again, you’ll get a (hopefully) much smaller / saner diff. If it turns out you were wrong about your branch being fully committed, you can use git-reflog(1) to reset your branch back to where it was before. If the diff looks inconsequential, you can use git rebase --skip to ignore it, and then git rebase-update will clean it up for you.

Once you’re done resolving all of the merge conflict, just run git rebase-update, and it will pick up where it left off. Once the command has finished updating all of your branches, it will return you back to the branch you started on.

Note
Running git rebase-update will update all your branches, but it will not automatically run gclient sync to update your dependencies.
MANAGING MULTIPLE CLS

Sometimes you want to work on more than one CL at once (say, you have a CL posted for review and want to work on something else). For each CL that you want to work on, just use git new-branch <branch_name>.

Once you start to have more than one CL at a time, it can be easy to lose your bearings. Fortunately, depot_tools has two tools to help you out:

$ git map

Note that this example repo is in dire need of a git-rebase-update(1)!

$ git map-branches

  cool_feature
    subfeature
  frozen_changes *

git-map(1)
This tool shows you the history of all of your branches in a pseudo-graphical format. In particular, it will show you which commits all of your branches are on, which commit you currently have checked out, and more. Check out the doc for the full details.

git-map-branches(1)
This tool just shows you which branches you have in your repo, and their upstream relationship to each other (as well as which branch you have checked out at the moment).

Additionally, sometimes you need to switch between branches, but you’ve got work in progress. You could use git-stash(1), but that can be tricky to manage because you need to remember which branches you stashed what changes on. Helpfully depot_tools includes two tools which can greatly assist in case:

git-freeze(1) allows you to put the current branch in 'suspended animation' by committing your changes to a specially-named commit on the top of your current branch. When you come back to your branch later, you can just run git-thaw(1) to get your work-in-progress changes back to what they were.

Another useful tool is git-rename-branch(1). Unlike git branch -m <old> <new>, this tool will correctly preserve the upstream relationships of your branch compared to its downstreams.

Finally, take a look at git-upstream-diff(1). This will show you the combined diff for all the commits on your branch against the upstream tracking branch. This is exactly what git cl upload will push up to code review. Additionally, consider trying the --wordwise argument to get a colorized per-word diff (instead of a per-line diff).

MANAGING DEPENDENT CLS

Now that you know how to manage independent CLs, we’ll see how to manage dependent CLs. Dependent CLs are useful when your second (or third or fourth or …) CL depends on the changes in one of your other CLs (such as: CL 2 won’t compile without CL 1, but you want to submit them as two separate reviews).

Like all of the other CLs we’ve created, we use git-new-branch(1), but this time with an extra argument. First, git checkout the branch you want to base the new one on (i.e. CL 1), and then run:

$ git new-branch --upstream_current <branch_name>
This will make a new branch which tracks the current branch as its upstream (as opposed to origin/master). All changes you commit to this branch will be in addition to the previous branch, but when you git cl upload, you will only upload the diff for the dependent (child) branch. You may have as many branches nested in this fashion as you like.

git-map(1) and git-map-branches(1) are particularly helpful when you have dependent branches. In addition, there are two helper commands which let you traverse your working copy up and down this tree of branches: git-nav-upstream(1) and git-nav-downstream(1).

Sometimes when dealing with dependent CLs, it turns out that you accidentally based a branch on the wrong upstream, but since then you’ve committed changes to it, or even based another branch off of that one. Or you discover that you have two independent CLs that would actually be much better off as dependent CLs. In instances like these, you can check out the offending branch and use git-reparent-branch(1) to move it to track a different parent. Note that this can also be used to move a branch from tracking origin/master to lkgr or vice versa.

EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH

This section will demo what a typical workflow looks like when writing, updating, and committing multiple CLs.

So there you have the basic flow. Note that you don’t have to do chromium development using these tools. Any git workflow is compatible, as long as git cl upload is able to upload good patches.

CONCLUSION

Hopefully that gives you a good starting overview on Chromium development using depot_tools. If you have questions which weren’t answered by this tutorial or the man pages for the tools (see the index of all tools here: depot_tools(7)), please feel free to ask.
